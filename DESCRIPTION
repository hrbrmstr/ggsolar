Description: Tools are provided to generate a dynamic list of convincing celestial object names
    using a small Markov chain model, construct orbital radii of uniform or specified/natural
    distances, place celestial objects randomly on the orbit circles using built-in or custom
    placement functions. Additional capabilities include the ability to output plots from a core 
    routine, generate a plotting template to further customize, and place labels next to celestial
    object. Some theme elements are also provided to speed up clean plot output generation.
